# Welcome

This is the official repo for Wyatt Olney & The Wreckage.

## Hosting and deployment

This project is hosted on [Vercel Now](https://vercel.com/home) - an all-in-one solution for static & JAMstack deployment.

Branches that are pushed to the GitHub repository will automatically be deployed to a preview environment - which will contain its own custom URL - thanks to our [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.

Once branches have been accepted and merged into `master`, they will automatically be deployed to [Vercel Now](https://vercel.com/home) and automatically aliased to [https://www.woatw.com](https://www.woatw.com).
